"""Kernel._seed_policies — config-time ACTIVATED policy seeding for the free (STARTER) tier.

Verifies the seeds register as enforcing ACTIVATED policies and that the shipped STARTER seed set
(an allow-baseline + a scoped deny guardrail) governs correctly — crucially that an action WITHOUT
``payload_amount`` is allowed (not fail-closed DENY'd by the guardrail's variable reference).
