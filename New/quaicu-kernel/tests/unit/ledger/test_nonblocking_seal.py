"""W8-1 — seal must not block the event loop while the signer makes its (blocking) network call.

A durable signer (Cloud KMS / OpenBao) signs with a synchronous network round-trip. `TrustLedger.seal`
runs `sign` via `asyncio.to_thread`, so other coroutines keep running during a seal. This test proves it:
with a signer whose `sign` blocks for ~150ms, a concurrent ticker still advances — and the seal still
produces a valid, correctly-signed entry.
