"""K·10 Drift conformance tests — spec-derived golden cases.

Invariants tested:
  - Drift measured against a recorded baseline (no live model calls).
  - Deterministic: same recorded inputs + same baseline → same PSI (F-09).
  - Breach when PSI ≥ threshold; stable when PSI < threshold.
  - Breach must route to K·12 incident (tested via DriftBreach shape, not side-effect).
  - Per-tenant: baseline is scoped to a tenant.
