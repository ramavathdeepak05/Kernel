"""K·11 Explainability conformance tests — spec-derived golden cases.

Invariants tested:
  - Explanation derivable from recorded inputs/results only — no model re-call (F-09).
  - Point-in-time: explanation reflects policies and inputs as recorded, not current.
  - Insufficient recorded data → derivable=False; caller must NOT re-call the model.
  - Explanation attached to audit replay: must carry action_id, policy_versions, decision.
  - Per-tenant: explanation scoped to tenant.
