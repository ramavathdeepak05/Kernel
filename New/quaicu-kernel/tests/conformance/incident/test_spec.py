"""K·12 Incident conformance tests — spec-derived golden cases.

Invariants tested:
  - Incident links to triggering ledger entry (F-09 replay reference).
  - Rollback action IDs are governed actions, not out-of-band effects.
  - Per-tenant isolation: incidents scoped to their tenant.
  - Status transitions are valid and reflected in returned incident.
  - Resolved incidents have resolved_at set.
