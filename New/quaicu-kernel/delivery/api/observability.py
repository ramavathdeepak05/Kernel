"""Request logging + correlation IDs (ADR-0011, WS-D).

`RequestLoggingMiddleware` is always on (it changes no behavior). For every request it:

  - assigns a correlation id (honoring an inbound ``X-Request-ID``, else a fresh uuid4) and exposes
    it on ``request.state.request_id`` and the ``X-Request-ID`` response header;
  - emits one structured access-log record on completion — method, path, status, duration, the
    routing tenant, and the request id.

This is the audit/compliance edge the metering and billing workstreams (WS-C) build on: the access
log is the durable record of *who called what, when*. Keeping it as a thin middleware means every
route — present and future — is covered without per-handler wiring.
