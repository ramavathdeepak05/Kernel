"""Crypto-shredding erasure routes (WS-G — GDPR / DPDP right to erasure).

  POST /v1/erasure/{tenant}/{subject}   → crypto-shred the data subject (destroy its key)
  GET  /v1/erasure/{tenant}/{subject}   → erasure status

Erasure does **not** delete ledger entries (the K·02 log is append-only / tamper-evident). It destroys
the per-subject encryption key so the PII ciphertext stored anywhere becomes irrecoverable, while every
Merkle proof still verifies. Same tenant-isolation guard as the audit trail; gated by the
``erasure:write`` scope. The erasure receipt is suitable for sealing into the ledger as proof the
right was honored.
