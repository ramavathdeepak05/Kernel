"""SDK-level error types.

Governance *outcomes* (deny / halt / pending approval) are the typed ``LifecycleError`` subclasses in
``core.errors`` — catch those to react to a decision. ``SdkUsageError`` is different: it signals a
**programmer error** in how the SDK was called (no actor in scope, a required adapter not configured).
It subclasses the frozen ``QUAICUError`` root so it carries a stable ``code`` and is catchable
alongside the rest of the kernel error tree, without adding a new type inside the frozen ``core/``
error surface.
