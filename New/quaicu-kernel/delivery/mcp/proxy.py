"""Governed MCP proxy (D2-1) — front a downstream MCP server, govern + forward.

`GovernedMCPProxy` sits between the agent and a DOWNSTREAM MCP server (the real tools). It mirrors the
downstream's tool list and governs every call before forwarding it — so the agent AND the downstream
tools need no code change; you just point the agent at the proxy. ALLOW forwards to the downstream;
DENY/HALT/PENDING block the call (fail-closed).

`downstream` is any object exposing ``async list_tools()`` and ``async call_tool(name, arguments)`` (an
``mcp`` ClientSession, or a stub in tests) — so the governance is unit-testable without a live server.
The ``mcp`` server-facing transport is wired lazily.
