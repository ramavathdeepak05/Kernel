"""Reusable MCP tool-call governance core (D2-1) — no ``mcp`` dependency.

`govern_tool_call` maps one MCP tool invocation to a governed kernel action: it wraps the tool's real
execution (`execute`) with `kernel.wrap(...)` — the full lifecycle (identity → policy → HITL gate →
execute → K·02 seal) — and turns the lifecycle outcome into a small `ToolOutcome` the MCP server/proxy
render back to the agent. Fail-closed: a policy DENY (or an infra HALT) never runs the tool; a
`require_approval` policy suspends the action durably (D1) and returns PENDING with the approval handle.

This core is pure kernel (imports only `core`/`delivery.sdk`), so it is unit-testable without the MCP
SDK; `server.py`/`proxy.py` import `mcp` lazily.
