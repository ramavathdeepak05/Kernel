# QUAICU MCP governance (D2-1)

Govern an AI agent's **MCP tool calls** with the kernel: every call is mapped to a governed action
(policy → HITL → K·02 seal). Fail-closed — a denied or unapproved call **never runs the tool**.

Install: `pip install .[mcp]`

## Outcomes (all sealed)
| Policy decision | Result to the agent |
|---|---|
| **allow** | the tool runs; its result is returned |
| **deny** | `isError` result — the tool is **blocked** |
| **require_approval** | `isError` result carrying the approval **handle** — the action is durably PENDING; a human approves via `/v1/approvals` (or the email/Teams link), then the agent retries (idempotent) |
| infra/tool failure | `isError` (fail-closed HALT) |

## Two ways to use it

### 1. Proxy an existing MCP server (drop-in — no client or tool code change)
Point your agent at `quaicu-kernel-mcp` instead of the real tool server; it mirrors the downstream's
tools and governs each call before forwarding.

```toml
# in your kernel config (KERNEL_CONFIG)
[mcp]
mode               = "proxy"
agent_id           = "agent:mcp"                 # sealed as the actor on every tool call
agent_roles        = ["agent"]
default_policy     = "mcp.tool"                  # the CEL policy that governs the calls
downstream_command = ["python", "-m", "my_tools_server"]
```
```bash
KERNEL_CONFIG=/etc/quaicu/kernel.gcp.toml quaicu-kernel-mcp
```

### 2. Govern your own tools (registered handlers)
```python
from delivery.sdk.kernel import Kernel
from core.types import Actor, ActorId
from delivery.mcp.server import GovernedMCPServer

kernel = Kernel.from_config("kernel.gcp.toml")
await kernel.startup()
agent = Actor(id=ActorId("agent:research"), tenant=kernel.tenant, roles=("agent",))

server = GovernedMCPServer(kernel, actor=agent, default_policy="mcp.tool")
server.register_tool(
    "wire_transfer",
    handler=lambda args: do_transfer(**args),
    policy="payments.transfer",              # e.g. a require_approval CEL policy
    description="Move funds between accounts",
    input_schema={"type": "object", "properties": {"amount": {"type": "number"}}},
)
await server.run_stdio()
```

## Reusable core
`delivery/mcp/governance.py::govern_tool_call(kernel, *, actor, tool_name, arguments, policy, execute)`
is a thin wrapper over `kernel.wrap(...)` (the same governed lifecycle the SDK decorators use). It has
no `mcp` dependency, so it's reusable and unit-testable — the server/proxy import `mcp` lazily.
