"""Standalone ledger-witness service (D3-2 follow-up).

An independent process that cosigns Signed Tree Heads — the out-of-process anchor that makes the
split-view/rewind defence real (the kernel and the witness are different trust domains). Run it with
its **own** Ed25519 key and durable state, separate from the kernel; the kernel calls it via
`adapters/ledger/http_witness.HttpWitness`.

    POST /cosign            (auth) — cosign an STH iff it extends the last seen; 409 on fork/rewind
    GET  /witness-key       (public) — {witness_id, public_key_pem} to pin
    GET  /last-seen/{tenant}(auth) — the witness's last-seen (size, root) for a tenant
    GET  /health
