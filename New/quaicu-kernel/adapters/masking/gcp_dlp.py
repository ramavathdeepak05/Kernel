"""Google Cloud DLP masking adapter — a `MaskingPort` that detects PII via Cloud DLP (W6-3).

Catches what the regex masker can't (person names, addresses, context-dependent entities, more
locales). boto…/the DLP SDK is lazily imported (``[gcp]`` extra) and the client is injectable for
tests, so this module imports with no extra dependency and is exercised without a real GCP project.

Detection model: ``inspect_content`` (with ``include_quote``) returns findings whose ``.quote`` is the
matched PII; we tokenize each quote into the supplied `MaskingContext` (reusing the same stable-token +
rehydration path as the regex masker), so the rest of the gateway is unchanged.
