"""016 — create witness_state table (durable, monotonic last-seen STH per tenant, D3-2 follow-up).

The ledger anchor witness (adapters/ledger/witness.py) must remember the last Signed Tree Head it
cosigned for each tenant — otherwise a restart forgets, and a replayed smaller STH after restart is
treated as a fresh first STH and cosigned (a silent rewind slips through). `PostgresWitnessStateStore`
persists that memory here so the witness's monotonic guarantee survives restarts and is shared across
witness replicas. Control-plane table (no RLS), like quaicu_accounts / quaicu_approvals.

Additive + idempotent (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS).
