"""InMemoryEventBusAdapter — in-process event bus for dev and single-process use.

Registers as adapter key ``"memory_events"`` in the Kernel adapter registry.
Emitted entries are appended to an in-memory list. A pluggable subscriber
list allows components to react to events within the same process (e.g.
incident detection, drift monitoring).

Not suitable for distributed deployments — use a Kafka or Redis Streams
adapter for cross-service fan-out.
