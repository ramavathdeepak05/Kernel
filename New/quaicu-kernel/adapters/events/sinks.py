"""Event-bus sinks — record every sealed governed action to an external stream (K·07).

These are `EventBus` subscribers (``Callable[[Action, LedgerEntry], Any]``) registered via
``event_bus.subscribe(...)``. They give a **durable, queryable record of every governed decision even
when the ledger is in-memory** (the free tier): the kernel emits a `LedgerEntry` after each seal, and
these sinks fan it out off-box.

- `LoggingEventSink` — writes one structured audit line per action to the ``quaicu.audit`` logger. On
  Cloud Run / Kubernetes the stdout line is captured by the platform's logging (Cloud Logging), so no
  database is required to see "what each client's product is doing". Pure stdlib, zero dependencies.
- `PubSubEventSink` — publishes each action as JSON to a GCP Pub/Sub topic for fan-out to BigQuery /
  SIEM / Chronicle. Lazy ``google-cloud-pubsub`` (``[gcp]`` extra); publisher injectable for tests.

Both are **best-effort** (the contract for K·07 emit): a sink failure is logged, never raised into the
seal path. Wire them config-driven via ``[events].log_sink`` / ``[events].pubsub_topic`` (see
``Kernel.from_config``).
