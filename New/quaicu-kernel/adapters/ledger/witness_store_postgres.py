"""PostgresWitnessStateStore — durable, monotonic witness last-seen store (D3-2 follow-up).

Satisfies `core.ledger.anchor.WitnessStateStore`. Persists the last STH the anchor witness cosigned
per tenant to ``quaicu_witness_state`` (migration 016), so the witness's rewind detection survives a
restart and is consistent across replicas. Advance is **monotonic at the SQL level**: the conditional
upsert only accepts a ``tree_size`` at or above the stored one, so a smaller (rewound) size can never
overwrite the stored high-water mark — defence-in-depth on top of the witness's own consistency check.

Synchronous (psycopg2, already a dependency), mirroring `adapters/hitl/postgres_store.py`. Cosign is
low-frequency (export + periodic anchor), not a per-action hot path, so the blocking call is fine.
