`PolicyEnvelope` is the authoritative, immutable representation of a policy as stored and evaluated
by the kernel. `ImpactReport` is the simulation artifact required by F-10 before any policy may
transition from REVIEW → ACTIVATED.

This file is governed by the same freeze rules as `core/types.py`: changes require an ADR.
