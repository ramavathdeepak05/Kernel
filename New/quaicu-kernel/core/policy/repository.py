"""K·01 Policy Engine — durable persistence port.

`PolicyRepository` is the structural async Protocol a durable policy backend implements (in-memory
for dev/single-process, Postgres for production). The `PolicyStore` uses it as a write-through
collaborator: the store stays the fast in-memory read cache (holding the compiled CEL programs,
which are not serialisable), and the repository persists the policy *rows* so they survive a
restart and can be re-hydrated (recompiling CEL on load).

This is a port (core depends only on this Protocol) — concrete adapters live under `adapters/policy/`.
