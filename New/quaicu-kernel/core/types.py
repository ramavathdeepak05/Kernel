"""QUAICU kernel shared value types — FROZEN contract surface.

These are the value types that cross layer boundaries: the lifecycle spine, the port signatures
(spec §5), and the integration shapes (Action, EvaluationResult, LedgerEntry) every layer agrees on.

Design rules (see AGENTS.md §3 and the `clean-code` skill contract):
- Domain models are immutable: `@dataclass(frozen=True)`. Express a state change by constructing a new
  value with `dataclasses.replace(...)` (or the provided `with_state` helper) — never mutate in place.
- This file is FROZEN. Changing a field, a signature, or an enum member requires the orchestrator +
  an ADR. Layers may freely *construct* and *consume* these; they may not redefine them.
- Per-layer internal shapes (e.g. the full K·01 policy envelope, the K·06 step DSL) are owned by their
  layer and are NOT defined here — only what is genuinely shared lives in this file.

Source of truth: build spec §5, the Glossary, and the lifecycle/ledger/gateway/process skills.
