"""EmailSender port — the kernel's only outbound transactional-email seam.

Used by the verified-signup flow (OTP) and account recovery. Async because the production adapter
makes a network call (a provider REST API); the kernel awaits it from the request path. Adapters must
raise `core.errors.EmailPortError` on any send failure so the caller decides fail-open vs fail-closed
(signup OTP fails closed — no email, no account).
