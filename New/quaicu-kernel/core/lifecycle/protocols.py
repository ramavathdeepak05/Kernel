"""Core-to-core collaborator contracts the lifecycle spine depends on.

The spine orchestrates K·01 (policy), K·02 (ledger), K·07 (events), and a storage-backed action
repository. So it does not start before they exist, it depends on these **interfaces**, which those
layers implement. Like the ports in `core/ports/`, these are stable contracts — change them via the
orchestrator + an ADR (AGENTS.md §3). This lets the spine be built and unit-tested with fakes now,
and K·01/K·02/K·07 plug in later.
