"""LifecycleEngine — orchestrates `propose → evaluate → gate → execute → seal → emit`.

Invariants this module enforces by construction (see the `quaicu-governed-lifecycle` skill contract):
- **No bypass (F-04):** `execute` is reachable only after `evaluate` (and `gate`, when required) pass.
  There is no public method that executes without evaluating.
- **Fail-closed (F-03):** any error/timeout/ambiguity → DENY (governance) or HALT (infra). Never proceed.
- **Seal before complete:** an action that executed but failed to seal is HALTED, never COMPLETED.
- **Idempotency:** a duplicate `(tenant, idempotency_key)` returns the existing action; it never re-runs.
- **Determinism:** the engine introduces no wall-clock or randomness into the decision path (the HITL
  poll loop is bounded by a count, not a clock).

`core/` purity: this module imports only `core.*` (ports, types, errors, lifecycle) and the stdlib.
