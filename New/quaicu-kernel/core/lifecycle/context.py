"""Actor context variable — set the governed actor once at the request/session boundary.

This is the zero-friction integration primitive. Instead of threading ``actor=`` through every
function call, a developer sets the actor once and all ``guard``/``wrap``-decorated functions
inside that scope automatically pick it up:

    async with kernel.actor_context(actor):
        result = await existing_function(arg1, arg2)   # signature unchanged

ContextVar semantics: correct for async tasks (each asyncio.create_task() inherits the parent
context at creation time, then runs in its own copy — no cross-task contamination).
