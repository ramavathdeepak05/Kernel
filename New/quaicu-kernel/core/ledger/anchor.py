"""Consistency monitor / anchor orchestration (K·02 / D3-2).

Bridges the tenant's ledger and an independent `AnchorPort` (witness): it reads the current Signed
Tree Head, computes a consistency proof from the witness's last-seen size, and asks the witness to
cosign. If the current STH is not a consistent append-only extension of what the witness last saw —
a fork or silent rewind — the witness refuses and `LedgerTamperError` propagates (fail-closed).

Call at export time (so the bundle carries a fresh cosignature) and/or periodically from a scheduler.
