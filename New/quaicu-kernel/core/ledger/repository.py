"""K·02 TrustLedger — durable persistence port.

`LedgerRepository` is the structural async Protocol a durable ledger backend implements (in-memory
for dev/single-process, Postgres for production). The `TrustLedger` uses it as a write-through
collaborator: the in-memory per-tenant Merkle trees stay the fast read/proof path, and the
repository persists each sealed `LedgerEntry` plus the latest Signed Tree Head so the log survives a
restart and can be re-hydrated (the tree is rebuilt from the stored leaf hashes).

This is a port (core depends only on this Protocol) — concrete adapters live under `adapters/ledger/`.
Implementations MUST wrap backend faults in `core.errors.LedgerPersistenceError`; the hot read path
(proofs, get_entries) never calls this — only `seal` (write-through) and `hydrate` (startup) do.
