"""K·13 → K·01 bridge: convert a SandboxRun + optional FairnessDelta into an ImpactReport.

The ImpactReport is the artifact F-10 requires before a REVIEW policy can be ACTIVATED.
This bridge assembles it from the counterfactual replay output without any I/O.

Rules:
- Pure function — no I/O, no async, no imports from delivery or adapters.
- `acknowledged` defaults to False — a human reviewer must set it True via the API.
- `decision_distribution` is derived from flip/unchanged counts as a conservative proxy.

    ``decision_distribution`` is a two-bucket approximation: unchanged decisions map to
    ``"allow"`` (they agree with the active policy) and flipped decisions map to ``"deny"``
    (they would change outcome). This is conservative — it treats any flip as a potential
    denial, giving reviewers a worst-case view. The exact per-decision breakdown is available
    in the SandboxDecision list returned by ``run_counterfactual_backtest``.

    ``acknowledged`` defaults to False. The F-10 gate requires True — the reviewer must
    explicitly acknowledge the report (via ``PUT …/impact-report`` or the inline ``activate``
    body) before activation is permitted.
