"""Per-subject data-encryption keys + crypto-shredding (WS-G).

A `ShredKeyring` owns one 256-bit AES key (DEK) per data subject. Encryption fetches/creates the
subject's DEK; **erasure destroys it** and leaves a tombstone so the subject is permanently marked
erased (any later decrypt fails fail-closed; a new key is never silently minted for an erased
subject). Keys live per tenant — a subject id is scoped by tenant so two tenants' subjects never share
a key (F-07).

`InMemoryShredKeyring` is the single-process default. A production deployment swaps it for an
HSM/KMS-backed keyring (the DEK never leaves the HSM; "destroy" calls the KMS key-destruction API)
behind the same interface — the engine and call sites are unchanged.
