"""K·10 Drift — computation engine.

Uses Population Stability Index (PSI) as the drift metric.
PSI = Σ (current_i − baseline_i) × ln(current_i / baseline_i)

Rules:
  PSI < 0.1   → stable
  0.1 ≤ PSI < 0.25 → monitor
  PSI ≥ 0.25  → breach (K·12 incident)

Invariants:
- NEVER re-call a model; compute only from recorded inputs.
- ALWAYS deterministic: same recorded inputs + same baseline → same PSI.
- On breach, the caller must raise a K·12 incident; this layer computes, does not side-effect.
