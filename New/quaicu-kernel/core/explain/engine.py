"""K·11 Explainability — derivation engine.

Invariants:
- NEVER re-call a model. The explanation uses only what was sealed in the LedgerEntry.
- ALWAYS point-in-time: the explanation reflects the policies and inputs as they were
  when the action was governed, not as they are now.
- If recorded data is insufficient, set derivable=False and return partial explanation.
  NEVER approximate with a fresh model call to fill gaps.
