"""AnchorPort — external attestation of Signed Tree Heads (K·02 / D3-2).

An *anchor* is an independent party that attests to each STH the kernel produces, so a compromised
kernel cannot present a split view or silently rewind its log undetected. The shipped anchor is a
**witness** that cosigns an STH only after verifying it is a consistent append-only extension of the
last STH it cosigned (`core/ledger/merkle.verify_consistency_proof`) — a fork/rewind is refused.

The port is mechanism-agnostic: a witness cosignature today; an RFC-3161 TSA token or a public
append-only receipt could implement the same shape later. The cosignature is embedded in the K·14
export bundle and verified offline by pinning the witness key (the same trust model as D3-1).
