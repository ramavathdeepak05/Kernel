"""MaskingPort (K·05) — abstracts the PII-detection engine behind the gateway's masking step.

The gateway tokenizes PII out of prompts before they leave the kernel and rehydrates it in the
response (`MaskingContext` holds the token↔value map). *How* PII is detected is swappable: the default
is the in-process regex masker (`core/gateway/masking.RegexMaskingAdapter`); a managed detector
(`adapters/masking/gcp_dlp.CloudDLPMaskingAdapter`, Google Cloud DLP) catches what regex can't — person
names, addresses, context-dependent entities, more locales.

The method is **async** because a managed detector is a network call (run off the event loop). It must
tokenize detected spans into the supplied `ctx` so rehydration is unchanged regardless of engine.
